## Info
This toolbox has a set of Geoprocessing tools that will create Attribute Rules for you.  

These tools export a CSV, which must be imported to apply the attribute rule.  It is best to do this in Design View so you can select the appropiate settings for the attribute rule

For a list of currently provided tools, review the doc
