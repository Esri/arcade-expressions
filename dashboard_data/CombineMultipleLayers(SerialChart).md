# Combined Multiple Layers 

This expression combines features from multiple feature layers. Each of the three sample data contains a record of how many vaccinations were allocated by each manufacturer (Moderna, Pfizer, and Janssen).     

```js
var portal = Portal('https://www.arcgis.com/');
// Create a FeatureSet for each manufacturer Feature Layer containing vaccination allocation data. 
// Group the features by the week of allocation 
var moderna = GroupBy(
    FeatureSetByPortalItem(portal,'20a80cd89db74c568db7cc9d2a13dc27',0,['*'],false),
    ['week_of_allocations'],
    [
        { name: 'moderna_1', expression: 'F_1st_dose_allocations', statistic: 'SUM' },
        { name: 'moderna_2', expression: 'F_2nd_dose_allocations', statistic: 'SUM' },
    ]
);

var pfizer = GroupBy(
    FeatureSetByPortalItem(portal,'45c991b4fd6642be8256a6b55f809311',0,['*'],false),
    ['week_of_allocations'],
    [
        { name: 'pfizer_1', expression: 'F_1st_dose_allocations', statistic: 'SUM' },
        { name: 'pfizer_2', expression: 'F_2nd_dose_allocations', statistic: 'SUM' },
    ]
);

var janssen = GroupBy(
    FeatureSetByPortalItem(portal,'d6bf72497e7e4bc69ef9c468e362ca3b',0,['*'],false),
    ['week_of_allocations'],
    [{ name: 'janssen', expression: 'F_1st_dose_allocations', statistic: 'SUM' }]
);

var combinedDict = {
    fields: [
        { name: 'manufacturer', type: 'esriFieldTypeString' },
        { name: 'week_of_allocation', type: 'esriFieldTypeString' },
        { name: 'count_of_doses', type: 'esriFieldTypeInteger' },
    ],
    geometryType: '',
    features: [],
};

// Loop through each of the three FeatureSets and store attributes into a combined dictionary.
var i = 0;
for (var m in moderna) {
    combinedDict.features[i] = {
        attributes: {
            manufacturer: 'Moderna',
            week_of_allocation: m['week_of_allocations'],
            count_of_doses: SUM(m['moderna_1'], m['moderna_2']),
        },
    };
    i++;
}

for (var p in pfizer) {
    combinedDict.features[i] = {
        attributes: {
            manufacturer: 'Pfizer',
            week_of_allocation: p['week_of_allocations'],
            count_of_doses: SUM(p['pfizer_1'], p['pfizer_2']),
        },
    };
    i++;
}

for (var j in janssen) {
    combinedDict.features[i] = {
        attributes: {
            manufacturer: 'Janssen',
            week_of_allocation: j['week_of_allocations'],
            count_of_doses: j['janssen'],
        },
    };
    i++;
}

// Return dictionary cast as a feature set 
return FeatureSet(Text(combinedDict));

```

We can use this expression to create a serial chart that shows both the cumulative count of vaccinations allocated each week and how many doses were allocated by each manufacturer.
