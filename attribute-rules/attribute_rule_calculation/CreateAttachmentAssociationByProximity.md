# Create attachment to structure within distance

This calculation attribute rule creates an attachment association to the closest structure within a distance

## Use cases

When adding fiber cable, clicking near the pole that it is attached too

## Workflow

Using ArcGIS Pro, use the Add Attribute Rule geoprocessing tool to define this rule on a feature class and optionally on a subtype in that feature class.  Use the following values when defining the rule, the other options are not required or depend on your situation.
  
  - **Rule Type:** Calculation
  - **Triggering Events:** Insert
  - **Exclude from application evaluation:** True


## Expression Template

```js
// *************       User Variables       *************

var filter_sql = "assetgroup IN (107) AND assettype IN (241)";
var feature_set = FeatureSetByName($datastore, 'StructureJunction', ["OBJECTID", "GLOBALID"], true);
var search_distance = 25;
var search_unit = 'feet';
var feat_globalid = $feature.globalid;
var valid_asset_types = [41, 42, 43];
// ************* End User Variables Section *************
if (indexof(valid_asset_types, $feature.assettype) == -1) {
    return field_value;
}

// Buffer the features to find features within a certain distance
var closest_features = Intersects(feature_set, Buffer($feature, search_distance, search_unit));
if (Count(closest_features) == 0) {
    return field_value;
}
// Filter the closest results based on the sql to get assets of a certain type
