# ArcGIS Arcade expressions

This repository is intended for sharing and maintaining reuseable Arcade expressions across all supported profiles.

## General workflow

These expressions are organized based on their intended [execution profile](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcade/guide/profiles/). The following folders correspond with each profile:

* [Any](https://github.com/ArcGIS/arcade-expressions/tree/master/any)
* [Alias](https://github.com/ArcGIS/arcade-expressions/tree/master/alias)
* [Calculation](https://github.com/ArcGIS/arcade-expressions/tree/master/calculation)
* [Constraint](https://github.com/ArcGIS/arcade-expressions/tree/master/constraint)
* [Labeling](https://github.com/ArcGIS/arcade-expressions/tree/master/labeling)
* [Popup](https://github.com/ArcGIS/arcade-expressions/tree/master/popup)
* [Visualization](https://github.com/ArcGIS/arcade-expressions/tree/master/visualization)

Click on the desired profile name to view relevant expressions.

> Note that expressions living in one folder don't have to be exclusively used in the associated profile. They can likely be used in different profiles, though they were designed for the profile indicated by the folder name.

Each expression lives in a Markdown file, which contains a general description of the expression, its use case, a depiction of the result, the code to copy, and an example of an executable form of the expression along with its output. It may also include a link to a web map demonstrating the expression in action.
