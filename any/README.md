# Expressions for any profile

This folder contains Arcade expression templates and functions that may be used in any of the execution [profiles](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcade/guide/profiles/).

## General workflow

Each expression lives in a Markdown file, which contains a general description of the expression, its use case, a depiction of the result, the code to copy, and an example of an executable form of the expression along with its output. It may also include a link to a web map demonstrating the expression in action.

See the list below for shared expressions.
