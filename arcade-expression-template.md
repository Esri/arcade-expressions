# [Expression-title]

> Summarize what this expression does while avoiding repeating what is described in the expression title. For example, introduce the expression in the context of the scenario you have used it. One paragraph is probably enough.

## Use cases

> Describe **what problem this expression solves** (from an application author's perspective). Describe scenarios/situations that apply and briefly discuss what the alternatives would be without using Arcade, if any.

## Workflow

> Explain the necessary steps to test the expression: 
> * Add any notes related to backwards compatibility (e.g. [Calculations across fields](./dashboard/dashboard_data/CalculationAcrossFields.md)) (if needed).
> * Specify changes to be made (e.g. [how to replace variables](https://github.com/Esri/arcade-expressions/blob/master/popup/url-basic.md#dynamically-create-a-hyperlink-in-a-popup)).
> * List of the product(s) supported.
> * Configuration requirements (e.g. [attribute rule values](./attribute-rules/attribute_rule_validation/require_reducer.md#workflow), service description, ...).
> * Using the provided sample data versus your own data (e.g. [sample vs own data](https://github.com/Esri/arcade-expressions/blob/master/dictionary_renderer/Conduit/Readme.md#workflow)). If sample data is provided, reference it.


## HTML Template 

> Use this one only if needed. Recommended in profiles like `popup`.

## Expression Template

> Add any necessary clarifications. Instead of embedding the example code, you may also reference an external file (e.g. [create points along line](./attribute-rules/attribute_rule_calculation/CreatePointsAlongLine.md)).

```js
// Your code here (comments are allowed)
```

## Example output

> Describe the result, add a depiction of the result (screenshot or animated GIF), link a live demo if possible (web map, web scene, custom app, ...).
